1. The C program in the file attached to this question intends to print an alternating pattern of 1’s and 0’s, based on the
number of rows entered by the user as follows:

101010……
010101……
…………….
…………….

where the number entered by the user is the number of rows and columns to be printed in the pattern. Fill in the blanks
A, B, C, and D with appropriate expressions so that the program works correctly. Consider the following test cases for
your reference.

Testcase 1    Testcase 2
Input - 2      Input - 5
Output - 10    Output - 10101
         01             01010
                        10101
                        01010
                        10101


2. Now, change what you entered in the blanks A, B, C, and D, so that the program prints a triangle of alternating 0’s
and 1’s instead of a square. Consider the following test cases for your reference.

Testcase 1       Testcase 2
Input - 3         Input - 5
Output - 1        Output -1         
         01               01
         101              101
                          0101
                          10101
